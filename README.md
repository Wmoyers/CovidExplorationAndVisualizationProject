# Project Summary
  In this project I explore 2020-2021 global covid data then create a Tableau dashboard including 4 visualizations.  My SQL code includes aggregate functions, 
joins, filters, aliases, group by, wildcards and more. I then imported this into Tableau and created an interactive map displaying infection % by country, total global stats in text form, a bar graph displaying total death count by continent, and % of population infected in five countries.
